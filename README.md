# Predicting Solubility. Cheminformatics

Reproducing a research article (by John S. Delaney
) by applying Linear Regression to predict the solubility of molecules (i.e. solubility of drugs is an important physicochemical property in Drug discovery, design and development).

This idea for this notebook was inspired by the excellent blog post by Pat Walters
 where he reproduced the linear regression model with similar degree of performance as that of Delaney. This example is also briefly described in the book **Deep Learning for the Life Sciences: Applying Deep Learning to Genomics, Microscopy, Drug Discovery, and More**.
